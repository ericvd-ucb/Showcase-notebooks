    "## Part 1.  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing Geographic Locations as Points\n",
    "Several different types of geographic data can be represented as points. Some typical cases with examples are described below.\n",
    "- Relatively small, discrete entities like as people, animals, trees, utility poles, and storm drains.\n",
    "- Features like buildings (houses, schools, hospitals, stores, cafes), parcels, historical landmarks, small parks and mountains that could be represented as polygons but often are simplified as points.\n",
    "- Events, often ambiguously bounded, such as crime locations, gatherings, politcal protests, urban fires.\n",
    "- Larger bounded features that are more often represented as polygons but can represented as points, typically located at the center of these areas, like administrative regions (cities, states), vegetation zones, land use zones, lakes, national parks, islands, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "One class of point maps visualizes location where features or events exist or transpired.\n",
    "- **Dot maps** simply show where featues are located. From this visualization you can begin to consider patterns or outliers in their spatial distribution.\n",
    "- **Cluster maps** are used when there are too many of features to effectively display as a dot map. Nearby features are grouped, or clustered, to better indicate the count of the number of features by location. Typically, when you zoom in on a cluster, the clusters decompose into individual point features.\n",
    "- **Density maps** are another way to map a large number of points. A function, such as kernel density estimation, is used to transform a set of points to a gridded data structure where each cell contains a value that represents the count of points per unit area. This is also called a heat map.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases we care as much or more about the data that have been collected at a location as we do the location itself. Several types of point maps can effectively highlight the attribute data. The choice depends on the **measurement scale** of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Category maps** extend dot maps by symbolizing point features by category. For example, a category map of crime locations might symbolize the different types of crime with different colors, e.g. \"red\" for homicide, \"green\" for robbery. Icons are also often used in dot maps. For category maps, the data, crime type for example, is a *nominal* measurement. Nominal data are also called categorical or quantitative data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proportional symbol maps** use symbol size to display the range of data values. The symbol size is proprotional to the data value. A larger symbol is used for with larger data values, and vice versa for small symbols. This technique requires numeric data, either ratio or interval. These data are also called quantitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graduated symbol maps** also use symbol size to display the range of data values, but the data values are first grouped into 3 to 7 (typically 5) classes rather than being unclassed like the proportial symbol maps. This makes associating the mapped points with data values easier. On the other hand the choice of classification method for grouping the data and the number of classes has a huge impact on the way the map conveys information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graduated Color map** are like graduated symbol maps but they use color not size to convey data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bivariate maps** are used to display the range and distribution of classified values for **two** attribute of the features. For example the graduated symbol may represent one attribute and graduated color another. Bivariate maps can be used to visualize two quantitative data attributes or one quantitative and one qualitative data variable in combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dot Density maps**\n",
    "*These would be cool to include but not sure if time.*\n",

Clever software will scale the symbols dynamically with the zoom level but that is a bit advanced. For now let's use the **radius** argument to set the size of the circle symbols. The units for the size are the units of the map's coordinate reference system (CRS), which in this case is meters - do you remember why this is so? What is the CRS of a web map?\n",

    "When symbolizing points by a data value you may want certain categories or values to display on top of the others. This will better communicate the data that is last drawn on the map because it will be more visible. You can accomplish this by having a column in your data that you can **sort** on. For example, we may want to emphasize high schools by displaying them on the top whenever there are overlapping points.  We can't sort on **Type** because an alphabetical sort doesn't give the order we want. Below we create a new column, *Type_order* on which we can sort."

For this reason **graduated symbol maps**, which group the data into 3-7 distinct classes, are often preferred."

    "### Classification Schemes\n",
    "The classification method and number of classes greatly impact the visual display of the mapped data. Five classes is often considered the optimal number that can be easily differentiated by the human eye. The selection of classification method or scheme requires much more thought and is dependent on the data being visualized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common classification methods that we will use include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equal interval** classification divides observations into N classes with equal data value ranges. For example, if your data values range from 0 to 50 and you have 5 classes, then the data will classed into the following bins: 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50.\n",
    "    - **Works great** if your data are well distributed across the full range of values. Also very easy to understand the bin mappings, or class breaks, and create comparisons accross time or data sets when using the same class breaks.\n",
    "    - **Not so great** if your data area skewed or have outliers and/or only occupy a few of the classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Quantiles** classification places an equal number of observations in each class. For example, if you have 10 observations and 5 classes the data will be ordered by value from low to high and the first two values will go into the first class, etc.\n",
    "    - **Works great** for creating good looking visualizations as it spreads the data values accross the range of symbology options. (good for linearly distributed data!)\n",
    "    - **Not so great** if it creates artificial groupings in your data. The problem with quantiles is that you can end up with classes that have very different numerical ranges. Quantiles can also separate locations with very similar rates and group together places that have very different rates, which is very undesirable, so use the histogram to see if this is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jenks** classification tries to creating groupings that minimize within group variance and maximizes between group variance. Thus, it is called **natural breaks** classification and an *optimal* classifier.\n",
    "    - **Works great** for visualiing the trends in the data.\n",
    "    - **Not so great**: for understanding the rationale for the classes. Difficult to compare two maps as the range of symbols will be different as. One drawback of this approach is each dataset generates a unique classification solution, and if you need to make comparison across maps, such as in an atlas or a series (e.g., one map each for 1980, 1990, 2000) you might want to use a single scheme that can be applied across all of the maps.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Manual** classification is based on the data scientist's knowledge of the data.\n",
    "    - Best if you want to compare maps so you can use the same classification scheme. Are there important break points that need to be “hardwired” into your class breaks? \n",

    "Graduated color maps are an alternative to graduated symbol maps. As the name implies, instead of changing the symbol size, you change the symbol color. With these maps the choice of color palatte - *the range of colors associated with the data values* greatly impacts how the map will be interpretted.  \n",
    "<p> There are two types of color palettes used for quantitiative data: (1) sequential and (2) diverging.  \n",
    "<p>Sequential palettes use one or more colors to create the impression of low to high values based on the lightness, saturation, or hue, eg white to pinke to read. Diverging color schemes are good if you want to identify an average or median values by a neutral color (white, light yellow, grey) and then use brighter colors to idicate lwoer or higher values. Divergent color schemes are particularly helpful for identifying outliers.  For more on color palettes see [colorbrewer.org](http://colorbrewer.rog)\n",
